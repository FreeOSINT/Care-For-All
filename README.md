## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was created with a dual mission:

1. **Empower people to understand the medical insurance system** in the United States—an intentionally complex and obfuscated domain that affects millions.
2. **Help users learn how to code, search, and use AI—all locally and for free—from within their browser.** No server, no cloud cost, no tracking.

## 🌐 Built to Run Entirely in the Browser

This project uses modern AI tools that run **fully client-side**, so users can:
- Search the web using intelligent agents
- Ask legal, medical, and technical questions
- Interact with their data using AI
- All without ever leaving the browser or sending data to a third-party server

No sign-ups. No data harvesting. No nonsense.

## 😤 The CORS Chronicles

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**.

> I did not expect for CORS to be such a pain.  
> It nearly drove me to rip my hair out in frustration.

After battling with countless restrictions, headers, failed requests, and inconsistent browser behavior, I stumbled across a few "workarounds" that probably shouldn’t exist—but do. Thanks to those, this system now actually works and can perform real searches, pulling in real data to assist users.

Let it be known: **CORS is the true final boss of web development.**

## 🚧 Status

This is a **prototype**, and development is ongoing. Here's what's done and what's coming:

### ✅ Done:
- Local AI chat in the browser
- Web-based search agent with real-time result extraction
- Educational UI focused on insurance literacy and technical exploration

### 🔜 Coming Soon:
- Public code release (pending legal clearance)
- Offline support
- Expanded coverage for non-US systems

Adding these as emojies the AI can use for added looks and as an homage to my dog:)
